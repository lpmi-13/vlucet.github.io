I am a M.Sc. student in the Biology department at McGill University, supervised by <a href=" http://gonzalezlab.weebly.com/">Andrew Gonzalez</a>. My research project for my master's thesis focuses on land use change, connectivity conservation and participatory modelling.

I have a special interest in computationnal applications, R package development and teaching code. See my <a href="/teaching">Teaching</a> tab for more info.
