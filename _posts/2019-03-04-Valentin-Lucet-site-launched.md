Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Thanks <a href="https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io"> Hank Quinlan</a> for the great website template
