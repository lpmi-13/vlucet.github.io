As a graduate student at McGill University, I am interested in modelling Social-Ecological Systems (SES). I believe SES modelling is best performed with interdisciplinary methods.

- My current project focuses on the conservation of fragmented habitats. I study how land use and land cover change impact the conservation of ecological connectivity.

- I make use of traditional methods of land use change modelling (geo-statistics and allocation algorithms), as well as participatory modelling methods via Bayesian Belief Networks.

- Science communication enthusiast, I am the co-founder of the Connecting Conservation Blog.
