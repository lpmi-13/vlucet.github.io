	Bayesian Belief Networks. I am conducting my master's thesis research in Montéregie, 
	Québec. I am interested in land use change: <a href="https://vlucet.github.io/research/CorridorsSynthesis">here</a> is 
	a map I produced to explore land use pattern in different municipalities of the region. It showing different land use 
	patterns of change. </p>
