  <h1>Research Interests</h1>
  <p>I am interested in modelling Social-Ecological Systems (SES), and I believe that
    SES modelling can benefit from interdisciplinary approaches: hence why my current
    research project uses traditional methods of land use change modelling (geostatistics
    and allocation algorithms), with participatory modelling methods via
    participatory mapping. I use the landscape of Montéregie near Montréal
    as a playground to study how land use and land cover change impact the outcomes
    of connectivity conservation efforts.</p>
