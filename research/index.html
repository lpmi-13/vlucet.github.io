        <h1>Research Interests</h1>
	<p>I study land use and land cover change modelling and participatory social-ecological system modelling with 
	Bayesian Belief Networks. I am conducting my master's thesis research in Montéregie, 
	Québec. I am interested in land use change: <a href="https://vlucet.github.io/research/MapMont">here</a> is 
	a map I produced to explore land use patterns in different municipalities of the region. It is showing different land use 
	patterns of change. </p>
